# Powerlevel10K Extensions (p10k-ext)

Work in progress. These are some extensions for [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for random things I use that I want as part of my prompt.

Powerlevel10K is designed to be extensible and support custom segments, so no need to fork it, just follow the [extensible](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#extensible) guide and hope for the best.
